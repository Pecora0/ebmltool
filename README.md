# ebmltool

## The Goal

A tool that helps to parse (and create) various kinds of EBML files.
It aims to have minimal dependencies and be hackable.

## The plan

Build an executable that takes a xml schema and creates a single file library for parsing binary files specified by the schema.

## Documentation

TBD

## Current Problem

I need an EBML file to test my generated library. Something conforming to the example scheme from the rfc is hard to find.
Should I switch to parsing matroska files? Seems like a step up in difficulty...
